# Vision Transformer (ViT)
Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) in Pytorch. ViT is presented in the paper, [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YicbFdNTTy).

# Implementation
The ViT code for this repo is based on the book ["Vision Transformer 入門"](https://gihyo.jp/book/2022/978-4-297-13058-9) written in Japanese. I added some code for dataset preparation and training procedures using [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
